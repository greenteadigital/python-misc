A *small* sampling of some of the python scripts I've written.

ipban2.py - Scan linux server logs & ban ip addresses making
            malicious or abusive requests

	--Periodically run this script to scan webserver (nginx) logs for
      abusive requests or vulnerability probes. Bans ip addresses
      based on predetermined signatures (see flags[] below), or
      manually by entering an offending ip address as an argument on
      launch.

	--Built & used with the nginx webserver on Fedora 14 Linux.
      Requires: root, iptables, nginx-style log format. Can be easily
      adapted to other Linux distros or log formats.

todo-mail.py - Send a quick to-do email to your desktop while you're
               away from your desk

	--Runs as a server-side web app and sends an email reminder
      containing the user supplied subject and message contained
      in the requested URL. I built this app for times when I was
      away from my desk and needed a to-do reminder to hit my inbox.
      Much more streamlined than using a full email client like Gmail.
      This is the server-side script. The connecting client could be
      another python script, a javascript enabled html file, etc.
